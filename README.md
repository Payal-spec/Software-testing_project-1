My first project is about an eCommerce platform : OpenCart.
OpenCart is a free, open-source eCommerce platform that allows businesses to create and manage online stores with ease. OpenCart is a PHP-based online store management system that offers:
- A user-friendly admin panel
- Product catalog management
- Multi-store and multi-currency support
- Various payment and shipping integrations
- Extensive extension support

- My project includes test plan, requirement, environment and test cases for this platform, which will help in the understanding of it's functionality and will help in tesing execusion.
